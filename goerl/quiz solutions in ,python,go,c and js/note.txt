The recursion approach is simple and straightforward but inefficient for large inputs due to the repeated computations. Memoization optimizes the recursive approach by storing the results of subproblems to avoid repeated computations, making it efficient for larger inputs. Dynamic Programming also avoids repeated computations and is efficient for larger inputs, but it builds the solution iteratively from the bottom up, which can be easier to reason about for some problems.
