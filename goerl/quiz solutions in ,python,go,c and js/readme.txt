 In Go, we manage dependencies using a go.mod file. If you don't have a go.mod file already, 

you can initialize it in your project root directory with the following command:

go mod init your_project_name. it will output the content below, look in go_pict.png for more details

'''
go: creating new go.mod: module Eugene
go: to add module requirements and sums:
	go mod tidy
'''

then run go mod tidy( i suspect it will correct the/indirect in the go.mod require command)



You should replace your_project_name with the actual name of your project.

Next, to add the pq driver as a dependency, run the following command:

go get github.com/lib/pq

This will add the pq driver to your project's dependencies in the go.mod file.

Now, you can run your Go code again. The pq package should be correctly resolved, and the error message should disappear.

Remember, Go projects follow a certain structure, and all your Go files that belong to the same package should reside in the same directory. Your go.mod file should reside in the root directory of your project. Also, note that Go uses a package management system which isolates dependencies for individual projects. 

Therefore, for the commands to work, it is important that you run them in your project's root directory where the go.mod file resides.
